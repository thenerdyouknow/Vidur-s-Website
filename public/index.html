          <p>Hi! </p>
          <p>My name is Vidur. Music is my dream.</p>
          <p> As a young child, you only ever hear “music isn’t a real career option”. And I grew up believing that. But the more I think about it, the more I feel like this is something I need to do. I want to do what I love. One year left in college, and this is my year to try my best to make music become more than just a “hobby”. To make this dream come true.</p>
          <p>If you're here, you probably saw me playing on the streets or saw one of my videos on Youtube. The response I've gotten from my music has been mind-blowing. From being told that I was "disgracing" my family, to being told it was a privilege listening to me, I've seen it all. And all I can say is thank you.</p>
          <p>Of course, being an independent artist isn’t easy, maybe even more so in India. But I have been trying my best to do whatever I can and get Blue Heart Beat off the ground. And you guys, the people reading this, listening to me, sharing my music and encouraging me are such a huge motivation to keep doing what I’m doing.</p>
          <p>It’s a truly humbling and heartwarming feeling to know there are people behind you who believe in you. It makes me feel like Blue Heart Beat is part of something bigger than just myself. Thank you for all the love and support. Thank you for dreaming with me. It means more than I can say.</p>
          <p> Love,</p>
          <p> Vidur </p>

              <h4>Patreon:</h4>
              <p>Seriously, this is a <b>great</b> way to support upcoming artists. If not anything else, just have a look at how it works: <a href="https://www.patreon.com/blueheartbeat" target="_blank"><b>Link To My Patreon</b></a></p>

            <h2 class="contribute-heading">Busking:</h2>
            <p>One of the major ways I get my music out to people is by going busking (ie, playing music on the streets). Unfortunately, I have faced a <b>LOT</b> of problems from local police who ask me to stop and leave. I was even arrested once in Bombay for doing this. It would be so amazing if you or someone you know could help get me permission to busk in areas of either Delhi or Bombay.</p>
            <p>India doesn’t have a lot of people who do this, and I am really trying to get myself out there, so fixing this problem would be phenomenal.</p>

            <p>If you have any photos or videos of mine, please do send them across, if possible. It helps to have good pictures to share on social media.</p>

            <p>More than anything else, just please share my music as much as possible. If you liked my songs, and like what I’m doing, please reciprocate by letting others know about me. I’m still figuring out how to improve my presence on social media, and you can really boost that.</p>
            <p>It costs nothing, and it goes such a long way. Even one more follower or subscriber matters.</p>
